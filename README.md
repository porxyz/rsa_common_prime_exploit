# RSA Exploit of keys with common prime numbers

Put the public keys/certificates inside of the public_keys folder.
The keys need to be in the OpenSSL PEM format.

If two keys have a common prime number, you can recover the private keys.
The recovered private keys will be stored in the decrypted_keys folder.

##### I put two vulnerable public keys for testing purposes.
